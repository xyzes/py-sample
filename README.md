# py-sample

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This project is a Python web application to manage, store, and edit metadata of multimedia files through the use of a database.
Features of the program will include:
<div>
  <ol> 
    <li>Real-time scanning of user library. Add new entries for new files, show missing files.</li>
    <li>Perform two-way CRUD operations (database changes trigger changes in file system and viceversa).</li>
    <li>Handle very specific requests, like finding files with empty fields or finding duplicates.</li>
    <li>A minimalistic interface to view the database and command changes in the file system.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
Originally intended as an application to allow music producers, DJ's, and other digital music workers to better organize their files safely and efficiently through its minimalistic interface, its final state will support many more files.
